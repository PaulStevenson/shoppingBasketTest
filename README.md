# Shopping Basket Code Test

You have been asked to model a shopping basket using TDD in Java.

## Requirements

You should be able to:

- add items to the shopping basket,
- remove items from the shopping basket,
- empty the shopping basket.
- Calculate total cost of items in the shopping basket

### Discount System

You should also be able to apply the following discounts to a shopping basket:

- Apply buy-one-get-one-free discounts on certain items
- 10% off on total baskets costing more than £20 (after previous discount is applied),
- 2% off on total for customers with a loyalty card (after all other discounts are applied).

You must be able to validate that the code works through passing tests.

Try to think about the design of your program. What if we added a new type of discount? Would you need to re-write a lot of your code to include a new discount?
